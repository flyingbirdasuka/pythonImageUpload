This repository demonstrates how to deploy a Python AWS Lambda function using the Serverless Framework. The image_upload Lambda function accepts a Base64-encoded image and a filename, decodes it, and saves it to a designated S3 bucket with a unique UUID-prefixed name. It returns the full URL of the uploaded image and logs any AWS client errors encountered during the process. This allows safe, serverless image uploads without file name collisions.
